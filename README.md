# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The aim of this project is to visualize a variety of sorting algorithms, 
which sort based on the hue of each colour. While there are many programs that visualize sorting algorithms, adding colour makes it much easier to understand how the algorithm functions.

### Getting Started
If you would like to add additional algorithms to the application, these are the steps you need to follow:
* Create a new class in SortingLibrary -> Algorithms
* Implement the ISorting interface
* Add the sorting name to SortEnums.cs
* Add your class to the switch statement in SortForm

### Prerequisites
.NET Framework and Visual Studio

### The following algorithms are currently implemented 
* Bubble Sort
* Cocktail Shaker Sort
* Gnome Sort
* Heap Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort
* Comb Sort
